NAME
    An extension to Time class that supports out of ranged values

SYNOPSIS
    Native "mktime" method is too strict.

      Time.mktime(2010, 1, 10, 26, 40)
      => ArgumentError: argument out of range

    We the midnight workers want flexible one.

      require 'night-time'
      Time.mktime(2010, 1, 10, 26, 40)
      => Mon Jan 11 02:40:00 +0900 2010 

      Time.parse('2010-01-10 26:40')
      => Mon Jan 11 02:40:00 +0900 2010 

    w00t!
